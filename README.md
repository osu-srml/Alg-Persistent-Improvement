# Alg-Persistent-Improvement

This is the code for our paper Algorithmic Decision Making under Agents with Persistent Improvement \url

There are 4 Jupyter notebooks:

- ```Empirical Calculations and Visualizations```: This notebook produces all plots except the ones in the Experiment section (e.g., Fig 2, 3, 4 in the main paper)
- ```Exam Score Experiment_Female```: Experimental results on Exam Score Data (female)
- ```Exam Score Experiment_male```: Experimental results on Exam Score Data (male)
- ```FICO Score Experiment```: Experimental results on FICO

All results can be produced by directly running the notebooks. [Our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01807) is more theoretical, so we recommend you check it directly.
